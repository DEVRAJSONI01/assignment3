## 🎯 Objective

Develop a program that can automatically detect potholes in road surface images using image processing and computer vision techniques. The system identifies and visually marks potholes, estimates their size, and provides detailed analysis reports.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Automatic Detection**: Identifies potholes using edge detection and contour analysis
- ✅ **Size Estimation**: Calculates pothole area in pixels and approximate square meters
- ✅ **Visual Marking**: Draws green contours and blue bounding boxes around detected potholes
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple images at once
- ✅ **Detailed Reports**: Generates text reports and visual summaries
- ✅ **Water Detection**: Successfully identifies water-filled potholes
- ✅ **Multiple Formats**: Supports JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### 1. **Preprocessing**
- Convert to grayscale for simplified analysis
- Apply Gaussian blur for noise reduction
- Enhance contrast using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)

### 2. **Edge Detection**
- Use Canny edge detector to identify pothole boundaries
- Detect transitions and edges in road surface

### 3. **Morphological Operations**
- Apply closing operations to connect broken edge segments
- Fill small gaps in pothole boundaries

### 4. **Contour Analysis**
- Find and analyze contours in the processed image
- Filter based on area, circularity, and aspect ratio

### 5. **Shape Filtering**
- Remove false positives using geometric properties
- Identify pothole-like irregular shapes with size constraints

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Click Run
```bash
python3 run_everything.py
```
This single command will:
- Install all dependencies
- Create sample images (if none exist)
- Run detection automatically
- Generate all output files

### Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
python3 setup.py

# 2. Add your road images to input_images/ folder

# 3. Run detection
python3 run_detection.py

# 4. Check results in output_results/ folder
```

## 📊 Output Files

The system generates 5 types of output files:

1. **`detected_[filename].jpg`** - Original images with potholes marked
2. **`detection_report.txt`** - Detailed text analysis report
3. **`detection_summary.png`** - Visual before/after comparison
4. **Individual analysis files** for detailed inspection
5. **Summary statistics** with counts and measurements

## 📈 Detection Results Example

```
POTHOLE DETECTION REPORT
==================================================

Total images processed: 3
Total potholes detected: 24

Image: road_sample_1.jpg
Potholes detected: 5
  Pothole 1: Area = 4692 pixels (~0.47 sq.m)
  Pothole 2: Area = 8760 pixels (~0.88 sq.m)
  ...
```

## 🔍 Algorithm Performance

- **Accuracy**: Successfully detects both small (0.02 sq.m) and large (2.26 sq.m) potholes
- **Water Detection**: Identifies water-filled potholes effectively
- **False Positive Filtering**: Uses geometric constraints to eliminate non-pothole features
- **Size Range**: Handles potholes from minor cracks to major road damage

## 💻 Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV 4.8+**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Pathlib**

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### For Your Own Images:
1. Copy road images to `input_images/` folder
2. Run `python3 run_everything.py`
3. View results in `output_results/` folder

### For Testing:
1. Run `python3 create_sample_images.py` to generate test images
2. Run `python3 run_detection.py`
